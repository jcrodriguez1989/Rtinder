title: "Rtinder: Unofficial API Tinder for R"
output: github_document
---

Are you a geek and want to meet people? Then Rtinder is for you! (just kidding)

Access the Tinder API for whatever you want: Data Science? Chatbot? Shiny app?

Since the tinder API is not publicly open. Without the github repository
https://github.com/fbessez/Tinder , Rtinder would not have been possible.

## Features

* Provides an interface to the tinder API.

* Allows swiping, getting matches, sending messages, among other functions.

## Installation

Rtinder is only available as a GitHub package. To install it run the following
from an R console:

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools"))
  install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jcrodriguez1989/Rtinder")
```

## Usage

From an R console type:

```{r}
library("Rtinder");
```
```{r eval=FALSE}
# When first using Rtinder, we should configure the account.
# It will save (by default) the config file in ~/.tinderAccount.R
# It will save just the access token, not the mail nor the password.
# Wont send info to any server besides Facebook. 
# You can see configAccount, it is open source ;)
configAccount('MY_FB_REGISTERED_MAIL', 'MY_FB_PASSWORD');

```
```{r eval=TRUE}
# Now we can check if it can connect to tinder.
# login() must be executed each time we load Rtinder library.
invisible(login());

# And finally we can start swiping!
mySwipes <- getSwipes(); # mySwipes is a list
fstSwipe <- mySwipes[[1]]; # fstSwipe is a list
names(fstSwipe);
names(fstSwipe$user);

```
